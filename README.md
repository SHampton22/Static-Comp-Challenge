# Static Comp Challenge
## Abstract
- This project was to choose one of the comps provided and challenge ourselves to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. We were not provided with any assets, nor native files and had to source assets on your own per the creative license guidelines.
- I chose to try and re-create the exact comp as closely as I was able in the given amount of time.
